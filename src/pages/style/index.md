## headers

never use level 1 (#) headers. 

prioritize using level 2 (##) headers and if needed, level 3 (###) headers.

sparingly use headers beyond level 3. 

never use bolded, italics, or underlined text as a replacement for headers. 

keep header text plain (namely, no bolded, italics, or underlined text).

prioritize keeping the headers short.

casual and friendly.

when you're linking external or internally, either incorporate it into the sentence as you see fit or start the link sentence with "see" followed by the link.

for example: "see [test] for more information."

if the link is a downloadable file, prefix is "download" then the downloadable file. 

for example: "download [test] for use."

use "-", not "*".
end all bulletpoints with a period (.).

## grammar

emojis used sparingly.

never use "na" or "n/a": use none.

never use e.g.: use "for example" or similar. 

never use i.e.: use "as in", "namely", or similar.

italics when: name of a product such as a song, book, film, etc.
