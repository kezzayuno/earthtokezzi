# earthtokezzi style guide

## terminology

everything is lowercased.

## tone

casual and friendly.

## links

when you're linking external or internally, either incorporate it into the sentence as you see fit or start the link sentence with "see" followed by the link.

for example: "see [test](...) for more information."

if the link is a downloadable file, prefix is "download" then the downloadable file. 

for example: "download [test](...) for use."

## grammar

lowercased everything. present tense. minimal passive voice, active voice is ideal and preferred. straightforward and simple writing (for example, no unnecessary descriptives and avoidance of market talk).

no abbreviations. for example, "ur" for "your" isn't appropriate. 

explanation points: none. 

question marks: none.

bold when: elements or objects in an instruction based article. for example, "**1 tbs**" for cooking articles or "**button**" for ui elements.

italics when: name of a product such as a song, book, film, etc.

underline when: rarely, pretty much never used.

caps when: if the name warrants caps, other than that, no caps.
